# Random-walk (Empirestate Building) game

## Rules

1. Before taking a step we roll the dice.
2. If Dice roll turns out to be 1 or 2 we take a step back.
3. If Dice roll turns out to be 3,4 or 5 we take a step up.
4. If Dice roll turns out to be 6, Bingo! Free hit chance comes up and you roll the dice again and take steps up equal to the next dice roll.
5. You start at ground level step 0.
6. As in reality the number of steps you are on can never be negative.
7. Oh and if you are clumsy, you have a fractional chance (0.1% chance) of falling down, in which case you would start from zero again.
